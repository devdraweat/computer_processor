This is a pipelined multiplier/divider unit (therefore, it can accept new inputs every cycle). The unit catches multiplication overflow, division by zero and it provides a data ready signal that is aligned with the final output of the operation (multiplication or division). Multiplication takes 32 cycles and division takes 33 cycles.
