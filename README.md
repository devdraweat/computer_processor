# computer_processor

This repository is full of components that are used in a 5-stage pipelined processor - with a 32 bit MIPs-like ISA.

All the components are written in structural Verilog, except for interior FSM modules.

I hope this repository serves as a reference resource for other students learning about basic processor design in their engineering classes.
